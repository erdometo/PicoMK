# PicoMK <!-- omit in toc -->

PicoMK is a highly configurable mechanical keyboard firmware designed for Raspberry Pi Foundation's [RP2040](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/rp2040.html). The chip features two Cortex-M0 processors. Based on the smp branch of [FreeRTOS](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/tree/smp), PicoMK supports multicore execution on RP2040. It's originally built for [Pico-Keyboard](https://github.com/zli117/Pico-Keyboard), but it can be easily adapted to other RP2040 based keyboards.
